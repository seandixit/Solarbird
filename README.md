Investigating how birds respond to a solar eclipse through community science

With the development of Solarbird, a community science app, we hope to encourage the public to connect with nature and the scientific process by collecting data on bird behavior throughout the progression of the eclipse. Solarbird will be accessible for individuals at all levels of expertise, from avid birders to young, budding naturalists, and data collection can happen anywhere â€“ at home, a local park, or by looking through a window.
